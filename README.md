🍽️ Restaurant Reservation Mobile Application
A full-stack mobile application that allows users to book tables at restaurants quickly and securely. The system combines a mobile frontend with a RESTful backend and a relational database.


🧰 Tech Stack
Mobile Interface: React Native (Expo)

Backend: Node.js with Express

Database: MariaDB

Authentication & Security: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt for password hashing

Developer Tools: Postman (for API testing), NetBeans


📦 Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Zournatzakis/restaurant-booking-app.git
cd restaurant-booking-app
Install Backend Dependencies

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

Set Up the Mobile App

cd ../frontend
npm install
npx expo start --tunnel

Start MariaDB

Ensure your database service is running locally and that credentials match your environment settings.


🔐 Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

env
Αντιγραφή
Επεξεργασία
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=restaurant_app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

📚 API Documentation
The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for:

POST /auth/register – Register a new user

POST /auth/login – Authenticate and receive a token

GET /restaurants – Fetch available restaurants

PUT /reservations/:id – Edit an existing reservation

DELETE /reservations/:id – Cancel a reservation

Test these using Postman or any other API client.
